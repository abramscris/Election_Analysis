# Election Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the election audit of the Colorado Board of Elections as requested.
With the process of auditing we will be able to identify percentages of total votes, a breakdown of numbers and refined information per county and candidates in the matter of this election, we will see more details further on.

## Summary

After analysis of the election results, we discovered the following information:

- There were 369,711 total votes cast in this congressional election.
- The county results for the precinct:
  - Jefferson capture 10.5% of the votes and 38,855 total count.
  - Denver capture 82.8% of the votes and 306,055 total count.
  - Arapahoe capture 6.7% of the votes and 24,801 total count.

## Election- Audit Summary 

As we could see by the end of this project the script for PyPoll_Challenge.py gave accurate information about the Colorado Board of Elections. This code covers the data analyzing for the second and third row of the data provided, what means this could be easily change if the user were to use more rows or add data to the data base.
I propose to the Commission election to use this code for different election data analysis. As an example, the program can be modified to determine which column read data changing the header row, this way you can have a different approach as deemed necessary. Also, another possibility would be read the data from additional columns as I can imagine you must have more complex data sets to cover, and this code can be applied for multiple information extracting.
